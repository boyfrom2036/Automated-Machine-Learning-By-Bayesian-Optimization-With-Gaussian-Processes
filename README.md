This repo contains the file to optimize the hyperparmeters using GPR-based Bayesian optimization and along with it , it contains its comparison with other optimization algorithm
Hyperparameter optimization is a critical task in machine learning where the objective is to find the best of hyperparameters for a given model to achieve optimal performance on unseen data. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not directly learned by the model during training but affect the learning process (e.g., learning rate, number of estimators in a random forest).

In this project we explore popular methods for hyperparameter optimization: Random Search, Using the hyper-opt library, Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The goal is to compare these methods in terms of their effectiveness and efficiency in optimizing hyperparameters for machine learning.
